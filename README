Running Main.py:

1.  Command prompt: Enter "python Main.py" from inside the Minesweeper
    directory.
    
2.  Alternatively, simply double-click on the file. 

Note: You will need to have Python 2.7 (or a later version) installed on
your computer for this to work. 



Differences between this version of Minesweeper and the standard version:

1.  Double-clicking (left clicking twice) uncovers all neighboring tiles,
    instead of left-clicking and right-clicking simultaneously.

2.  Players can flag suspected tiles as in the standard version, but 
    question marks are not supported in this version.

3.  Flagged tiles are still "click-able" in this version, so be sure not
    to left-click on a tile that's been marked with a flag: If it's a mine,
    it will explode!

4.  This version does not currently display a timer, mine count, or smiley 
    face. Will attempt to add these features soon.
